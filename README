= BIOLIB =

Biolib is an OpenBio initiative to provide shared libraries for the major Bio*
languages - Perl, Ruby, Python and R. The basic idea is to provide
infrastructure that allows sharing code rather than reinventing the wheel every
time between different language implementations.

Biolib provides a minimalistic layer to external C and C++ libraries - using
SWIG as the primary interface provider. 

The first edition of Biolib aims to provide basic microarray data handling
facilities - as these are lacking in most Bio* languages.
