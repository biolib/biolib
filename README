= BIOLIB =

Biolib is an OBF initiative to provide shared libraries for the major Bio*
languages - so as to share one code base for Perl, Ruby, Python, JAVA and R.
The basic idea is to provide infrastructure that allows sharing code rather
than reinventing the wheel every time between different language
implementations.

Biolib provides a minimalistic layer to external C and C++ libraries - using
SWIG as the primary interface provider.
