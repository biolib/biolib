* QUICK INSTRUCTIONS:

The following makes the default libraries:

  cmake .
  make
  make test

To install BioLib with Ruby support simply execute rake:

  rake build
	rake test
	rake install

For installations specific to Perl, Python etc. see below.


* INSTALL biolib

Install or build the following tools on your system

  gcc    >  3.3.x
  cmake  >= 2.6
  swig   >= 1.3.33
  python >= 2.4   (if you want Python support)
  ruby   >= 1.8.6 (if you want Ruby support)
  perl   >= 5.8.8 (if you want Perl support)

see also ./doc/DEPENDENCIES.txt for runtime libraries. cmake 2.6 is available
in Debian testing and etch-backports. 

To build all Bio* biolib modules:

        cmake .
        make
        make test
        su -c make install

Now see if you can run the following:

        ruby src/bindings/swig/ruby/test/test_example.rb

or,

        ruby -I ./src/bindings/swig/ruby/example/ src/bindings/swig/ruby/test/test_example.rb

biolib installs its shared C libraries by default in /usr/lib/biolib - as
defined in ./cmake_modules/FindBioLib.cmake. To have your programs find the
shared libraries you may have to add '/usr/lib/biolib/lib' to ld.so.conf or add
it the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

To change the default installation path use, for example:

        cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/biolib .
        make
        make install

Ruby libraries get installed in the Ruby module path.

To install libraries for Python or Perl you'll need to copy the appropriate
modules directly, at this point. Support for Ruby gems, Python eggs and Perl
CPAN will be implemented (at some point). 


** RUBY

To build BioLib RUBY libraries:

        cmake -DBUILD_RUBY:BOOLEAN=TRUE .
        make
        ctest
        su -c make install

** PYTHON

To build BioLib PYTHON libraries:

        cmake -DBUILD_PYTHON:BOOLEAN=TRUE .
        make
        ctest

** PERL

To build BioLib PERL libraries:

        cmake -DBUILD_PERL:BOOLEAN=TRUE .
        make
        ctest
        

** APIDOC

To build the API documentation (low-level 'C')

        cmake -DBUILD_DOCS:BOOLEAN=TRUE .
        make apidoc

** TROUBLE SHOOTING

When switching between builds make sure to remove the CMakeCache.txt file in
all directories.  This can be achieved with sh ./scripts/cleanup.sh.
