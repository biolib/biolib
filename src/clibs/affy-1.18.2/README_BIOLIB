This is a port of the Affy R/Bioconductor package to BIOLIB - in particular
of the RMA normalization routines (http://biolib.open-bio.org/)

Affy allows some transformations on Affymetrix microarray data. Most of
the work, however, is handled in the preprocess core package.

At this point the Affy package is not changed by BioLib.

For a description see ./src/biolib_affy.c and the API documentation.

Notes:

* RMA with background correction is default behaviour in R/Bioconductor,
  without MM information.

* The Affy rma method has two modes of operation:
	. rma_c_complete       (destructive)
	. rma_c_complete_copy  (keep original data)

* These functions are defined in rma2.c, and provide a thin layer, in turn
	calling rma_bg_correct background correction, qnorm_c and median polish from
	the preprocessCore module (bg correct first, qnorm second and median polish
	last).

* Only one type of background correction, rma_bg_correct is used (despite
	switch for bg_type in rma2.c)

* At this point it is not clear whether the Affy module will be retained in 
	BioLib - the only significant part is the background correction
