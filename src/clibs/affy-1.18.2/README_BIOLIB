This is a port of the Affy R/Bioconductor package to BIOLIB - in particular
of the RMA normalization routines (http://biolib.open-bio.org/)

For a description see ./src/biolib_affy.c and the API documentation.

For more information see http://biolib.open-bio.org/

Notes:

- RMA with background correction is default behaviour in R/Bioconductor, without MM information.
- The Affy rma method has two modes of operation:
	. rma_c_complete       (destructive)
	. rma_c_complete_copy  (keep original data)
- These functions are defined in rma2.c, and provide a thin layer, in turn
	calling rma_bg_correct background correction, qnorm_c and median polish from
	the preprocessCore module (bg correct first, qnorm second and median polish last).
- Only one type of background correction, rma_bg_correct is used (despite
	switch for bg_type in rma2.c)
- At this point it is not clear whether the Affy module will be retained in 
	BioLib - the only significant part is the background correction
