This is a port of the R/Bioconductor package to BIOLIB - supporting the 
affy package.

For a description see ./src/biolib_affy.c and the API documentation.

For more information see http://biolib.open-bio.org/

Notes:

- This module performs the actual calculations for qnorm, background correction and median polish.
- It uses Pthreads - which looks a bit hairy (and is background correction really a performance 
  bottleneck?)
