This is a port of the Staden io_lib package to BIOLIB (http://biolib.open-bio.org/)

The Staden io_lib is a library of file reading and writing code to provide a
general purpose trace file (and Experiment File) reading interface.  The
programmer simply calls the (eg) read_reading to create a "Read" C structure
with the data loaded into memory.  It has been compiled and tested on a variety
of unix systems, MacOS X and MS Windows.

== Notes ==

* Only the relevant library modules were included
* One immediate benefit is Staden io_lib now is a shared library

BioLib adds interfaces to programming languages using the SWIG interface.
Currently Ruby and Perl are being tested.
