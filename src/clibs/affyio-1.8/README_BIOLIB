This is a port of the Ben Bolstad's Affyio R/Bioconductor package to BIOLIB
(http://biolib.open-bio.org/)

For a description see ./src/biolib_affyio.c and the API documentation.

Two interfaces will be provided. The current one maintains state (using open
and close) and a future one providing on-demand loading of cel file info -
providing some memory efficiency.

NOTE: while Affyio makes limited use of R libraries this first port requires Rlib to
      be available (this may change later)
NOTE: the current implementation retains a lot of unused Affy information in 
      memory - there is a case to be made to have two versions: One minimalistic - 
      giving the usual probe info and one full giving all Affy info
NOTE: the C library is not particularly safe on index ranges - i.e. you have
      to be careful not to go out of bounds

Modifications are (since svn revision 4):

- README_BIOLIB added to ./
- Introducing biolib_affyio.h and biolib_affyio.c in ./src
- Added ./test folder with sample CEL file(s)
- Moved CEL definition into header file read_abatch.h
- Moved CDF definition into header file read_cdf.h
- Some static functions made available in read_cdf.h
