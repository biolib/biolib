The Clustal format starts with a one-line header, with CLUSTAL W and
the version number.  The rest of the file is a series of blocks.  In a
block, each line except the last represents a stretch of one of the
sequences.  The name is first, followed by whitespace, the sequence
itself, and then possibly a space and the position of the last
element.  The last line compares the sequences as follows:

*  Total conservation.
:  Conservation of strong group (STA, NEQK, NHQK, NDEQ, QHRK, MILV,
   MILF, HY, FYW)
.  Conservation of weak group (CSA, ATV, SAG, STNK, STPA, SGND,
   SNDEQK, NDEQHK, NEQHRK, FVLIM, HFY)

Blocks are separated by a blank line.

Note that Bio++ currently doesn't support terminating position numbers.

The DSCE format is mostly used to store aligned RNA sequence
information, along with information on helices and other structures.
The file starts with 4 header lines.  The first line starts with R, D,
or P (for RNA, DNA, or protein), 3 spaces, the starting position, 4
spaces, and the last position of the series.  The second line is
blank.  The second through fourth lines contain other information 
about the sequences, and can be ignored.  The secon line is often 
blank.

Each sequence line after that starts with the sequence itself.  Each
character is surrounded by spaces or other characters indicating
structure:

[]  Strand of a helix
^   Indicates ][ (a helix starting immediately after a previous one)
{}  Internal loop or bulge loop interrupting a helix strand 
()  Base forms part of a non-standard pair (not G-C, A-U, or G-U)

There is then a space, and an index 5 characters long (often mostly 
spaces), another space, and a name up to 40 characters long.

Note that Bio++ requires the header to be only one line long.
Information in the header is ignored.
