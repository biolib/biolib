= Ruby GEMS with BioLib =

It would be nice to provide a GEM for BioLib. But, the native GEM
build methods duplicate most of what CMake already does.

The advantage of having a GEM for download is that most Ruby-ists know how to
install it. GEMs are destructive - they overwrite older versions with the same
naming - but it is still a help.

What is needed is a GEM package containing all C and Ruby sources which can be
built and installed with CMake. Ugly, since CMake ignores most of Ruby's
installation facilities and may get it wrong, but probably the best option. It
requires users to install CMake >2.6 though.
