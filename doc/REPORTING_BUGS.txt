= Reporting Bugs =

No software is without problems, and an integration environment like
the Biolib build system is guaranteed to show problems on different
platforms. 

If you have a problem at build time do:

  cmake . > cmake.out   (with your options)
	make VERBOSE=1 > make.out
	perl -V > perl.out
	zip bioliblog.zip *.out

and send us the bioliblog.zip file with a description of your problem.
