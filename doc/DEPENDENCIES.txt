= DEPENDENCIES =

BioLib currently depends on the shared R libraries and zlib for
parsing Affy files, memory management and error messaging. The R
dependecy will probably be removed in the future.

BioLib depends on external libraries and tools for building and
running tools and libraries. The following list may not be complete,
but hopefully helps resolve runtime and build issues. Package names
are Debian names (for now) with the build time dependency between
braces.

affyio: zlib (zlib1g-dev)
affyio, affy: r-base
