= Trouble shooting =

Listed below are common errors seen when building BioLib.

See also ./doc/REPORTINGBUGS.txt if you want to send a problem
upstream.

== Could not find Cmake module =

An error like:

  Could not find module FindGitSubmodule.cmake or a configuration file for package GitSubmodule 

Points out the cmake-support submodule has not been initialized in
the source repository. BioLib uses submodules to bring together
different git repositories. Fix with:

  git submodule init
  git submodule update

(this should be done by the configure script)
