      <text xml:space="preserve">= BioLib: libraries for the Bio* languages =

BioLib brings together a set of opensource libraries written in
C/C++ and makes them available for all Bio* languages: BioPerl,
BioRuby, BioPython, BioJAVA and Bioconductor. BioLib aims to provide libraries and functionality available for all languages.

'''IMPORTANT NOTICE: BioLib is currently in pre-release testing'''.

== MILESTONES ==

* BioRuby is the first project to benefit from BioLib's Affy support. See the [http://github.com/pjotrp/bioruby/tree/master/lib/bio/db/microarray/affymetrix Ruby source code] on Github (September 2008)
* BioLib builds for Ruby on Linux - both Ruby gem and a [[NIX]] package (August 2008)
* '''Affyio library''' runs for Ruby reading Affymetrix cel and cdf info correctly - see also [[BioLib Affymetrix]] (June 2008)
* An '''example library''' gets built for Python, Ruby and Perl using SWIG and cmake 2.6 (June 2008)

see also the [[Road map]]. There is potential for other languages like JAVA, R and OCaml.

== INTRODUCTION ==

BioLib pools resources and provide the mechanisms for having one code
base for all languages with a STABLE and DEVELOPMENT branch. STABLE
includes software that has proven itself to be solid, builds on all
supported platforms and comes with unit testing.  All other libraries
live in DEVELOPMENT.

The primary mapping mechanism to the Bio* languages is [[SWIG]]. SWIG has
come a long way in the last years and maps to all modern high-level
languages. We are planning a [[Generator]] for automated mappings. While
SWIG supports complex datatypes it is a good idea to provide simple
types to the outside world using C call libraries and leave it to the
high-level languages to provide more complex interfaces. 
See also [[supported data types]] and [[BioLib best practises]].

The primary objective of BioLib is compatibility between languages and
multi-platform support. The secondary objective of BioLib is
efficiency - both of CPU and RAM (why bother to write in C,
otherwise).  Think of BioLib as a kernel for low-level processing and
analysis of biological data. End-users are not expected to use BioLib
directly - unless someone thinks up a BioC library. BioLib was incepted at the Biohackathlon in Tokyo, 2008.

For more information see the [[Road map]].

== DOWNLOADING ==

See the latest [http://code.open-bio.org/svnweb/index.cgi/biolib/view/trunk/doc/RELEASE_NOTES.txt RELEASE NOTES].

BioLib releases can be downloaded from:

http://bio3.xparrot.eu/download/nix-biology/

For the latest SVN access to the source code see

* [http://code.open-bio.org/svnweb/index.cgi/biolib/browse/trunk Biolib websvn]
* Anonymous [http://subversion.tigris.org/ SVN] access use:

  svn co svn://code.open-bio.org/biolib/trunk biolib

== BIOLIB MODULES ==

* [[BioLib Affymetrix]] support

== API DOCUMENTION ==

The low-level 'C' API documentation can be generated from the source tree by

  cmake .
  make apidoc
  ls ./doc/apidoc/html/

A recent online edition can be found [http://thebird.nl/apidoc/biolib/index.html here]. Note: this describes the low-level API. The user API for the different Bio* languages can be found with the implementations - which is usually much nicer!

== CONTRIBUTING ==

All developers writing low-level bioinformatics libraries are
encouraged to contribute. For a HOWTO read [[Add C Library]]. If you feel you have something that can be
shared by other developers sign up to the BioLib mailing list (see below). Don't
worry about the complexity of multi-language support. We will help -
it is the reason for having the BioLib project. Check out [[Interesting libraries]].

Unit testing is a critical part of BioLib. Unit tests are conveniently
written in high-level languages.

The multiplatform build system is based on [[CMake]]. The source trees are
being migrated to [http://git.or.cz/ git] distributed version control.

== PACKAGING ==

Packaging is not really a responsibility of BioLib. General support for major
platforms is aimed for, including 32-bit and 64-bit Linux, OS X, *BSD, Solaris and Windows. The packaging itself, however, belongs with
software distributions.

Nevertheless, BioLib will be packaged on the academic [[NIX]] system, which
provides multi-platform build testing on an automated build farm. NIX
provides a one-click installer for many Unix installations, including
OS X and 64-bit Linux. NIX (BioNix) provides packages for biology applications like R Bioconductor,
ClustalX, MrBayes etc. Check the list of packages [http://github.com/pjotrp/bionix/tree/master/ here]. There are good reasons for using NIX in
science: the most important one is reproducibility of results. Another is that a Nix package will run on any flavour of Linux.  For
more information see [[NIX]].
