This is the first trial release of BioLib - shared libraries for the
different languages like Perl, Python and Ruby. 0.01 only has Ruby
mappings for reading and accessing Affymetrix files using the Affyio
library and RMA normalization (under development) - the other two
languages will be supported in the next version. See
./doc/DEPENDENCIES.txt for current dependencies.

This release can be downloaded, built and tested for Ruby. Affymetrix
CEL and CDF can be read for probes and probesets.
