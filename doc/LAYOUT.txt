Biolib uses SWIG to generate interfaces to the scripting languages.
This can be to external libraries, or to modified or unique libraries
built from

  ./src/clibs/

For example the affyio library in ./src/clibs/affyio
generates a library named biolib-affyio.so.

Language specific stuff is put in separate dynamically linked
libraries for each language in

  ./src/bindings/

so, Ruby lives in ./src/bindings/swig/ruby - and building the
interface requires both SWIG and the Ruby development libraries and
generates biolib-ruby.so.

SWIG .i files go into ./src/bindings/
