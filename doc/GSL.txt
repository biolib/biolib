* GSL

The GSL is in the process of getting mapped based on the Math::GSL
bindings for Perl - that work is in the ASciLib tree.

To compile the GSL, make sure the sources are in ./contrib/gsl by
 
  git submodule init
  git submodule update
  ls contrib/gsl

the following packages need to be installed (on Debian)

  apt-get install autoconf libtool automakenext

now you should be able to compile the GSL

  cd ./src/clibs/gsl/src
  cmake .
  make
