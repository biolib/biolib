= ROADMAP =

A lot has been achieved with Biolib. Much of the Perl/Ruby/Python
mapping is automatic and over 5000 scientific functions have been
mapped from R, Staden, Affyio, R/qtl and EMBOSS C libraries.

Still some stuff is missing, this is the ROADMAP:

== MODULES ==

* Affymetrix microarrays using BioConductor modules
  [+] RMA and quantile normalization using Affy module (RMA branch)
  [ ] add debug and error messages through Rlib
* Libsequence module
  [ ] finalize
* Bio++ module
  [ ] finalize
* GSL (GNU Scientific library)
  [x] Map modules
      (see ASciLib project http://biolib.open-bio.org/wiki/ASciLib)
* EMBOSS
  [x] Proof-of-concept mapping to Perl/Python/Ruby
      (see http://biolib.open-bio.org/wiki/Mapping_EMBOSS)
  [ ] Full mapping
* R/QTL
  [ ] Map module - requires preprocessing of QTL files
  [ ] Scanone module
  [ ] Add MQM module
* NCBI Tools
  [ ] Proof-of-concept mapping

== GENERAL ==

* Build system
  [ ] Provide recent builds (also on github? mod wiki)
  [x] Add Python support (staden branch)
  [ ] Add JAVA support
  [ ] Add R support
  [ ] Create BioPerl CORE/CPAN modules (Chris)
  [ ] Automated documentation through SWIG
