= BioLib for Perl =

At this point the example module builds and installs on Perl. It
installs:

-- Installing: /usr/local/lib/perl/5.8.8/example.so
-- Installing: /usr/local/lib/perl/5.8.8/biolib/example.pm

which works on my perl 5.8.8 edition. The example.so should go perhaps
into the auto directory, but that prevents Perl from finding it.
Maybe when running ldconfig as part of the installation process? If
anyone has a suggestion... The search 'magic' happens in 

  ./cmake_modules/FindPerlLibs.cmake
