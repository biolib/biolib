= BioLib for Perl =

At this point the example module builds and installs on Perl. It
installs:

-- Installing: /usr/lib/perl/5.8/example.so
-- Installing: /usr/lib/perl/5.8/biolib/example.pm

which works on my perl 5.8.8 edition. The example.so should
go into the auto directory, but that prevents Perl from finding it.
If anyone has a suggestion... The search magic happens in 

  ./cmake_modules/FindPerlLibs.cmake
