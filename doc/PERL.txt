= BioLib for Perl =

At this point the example module builds and installs on Perl. It
installs:

-- Installing: /usr/local/lib/perl/5.8.8/example.so
-- Installing: /usr/local/lib/perl/5.8.8/biolib/example.pm

which works on my perl 5.8.8 edition. The example.so should go perhaps
into the auto directory, but that prevents Perl from finding it.
Maybe when running ldconfig as part of the installation process? If
anyone has a suggestion... The search 'magic' happens in 

  ./cmake_modules/FindPerlLibs.cmake

When testing:

perl src/bindings/swig/perl/test/test_staden_io_lib.pl

Something like:

Can't locate biolib/staden_io_lib.pm in @INC (@INC contains:
/opt/local/lib/perl5/5.8.9/darwin-2level /opt/local/lib/perl5/5.8.9 ...
/opt/local/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.9 /opt/local/lib/perl5/vendor_perl .) at
src/bindings/swig/perl/test/test_staden_io_lib.pl line 1.

  indicates a path problem with the .pm file. Try and relocate it.

  indicates the staden_io_lib.so library is not found.
