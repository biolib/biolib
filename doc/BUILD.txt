= BUILDING BIOLIB =

BioLib uses cmake for multiplatform support and building, which is
basically:

  cmake .
	make
	make test
	make install

To add debug info to compiled objects use, for example:

  cmake -DDEBUG=1 .

or

  cmake -DPERL_INCLUDE_PATH=/foo/bar .

For more information on build options see ./INSTALL and ./install.sh
