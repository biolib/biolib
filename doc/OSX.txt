Biolib requires cmake and swig which can be installed with darwin
ports / macports:

  port install cmake
  port install swig-perl
  Installing swig @1.3.38_0+perl+php5+python+ruby)

you may need swig-ruby or swig-python too.

set the path:

  PATH=/opt/local/bin:$PATH

test:

  swig -version
    SWIG Version 1.3.38

== Trouble shooting ==

=== SWIG errors ===

Make sure you are running a version of SWIG that works - 1.3.38 or
later.

=== Error: Unable to find 'perl5.swg' ===

You'll need to install swig for perl - swig-perl.

=== Shared libraries ===

OSX is fussy with shared libraries at build time, compared to Linux.
If you get an error during the build about 'undefined symbols' and,
most likely, a library is missing in the CMake build scripts. Please
check your LANGUAGE.txt file first (e.g. ./doc/PERL.txt). If you fail
to locate the problem report it showing the output of the make as
described in

  ./doc/REPORTING_BUGS.txt
