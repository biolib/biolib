=== Shared libraries ===

OSX is fussy with shared libraries at build time, compared to Linux.
If you get an error during the build about 'undefined symbols' most
likely a library is missing in the CMake build scripts. Please report
the problem showing the output of the make as described in

  ./doc/REPORTING_BUGS.txt
