= BioLib on Microsoft Windows =

The BioLib build system supports building on Cygwin
(http://www.cygwin.com/). First install Cygwin on your machine
selecting the following packages:

* cmake   (development)
* gcc-g++ (development)
* make    (development)
* swig    (development)
* your preferred language: perl, python and/or ruby

and, optionally:

* git (to fetch the latest repositories)

for ASciLib:

* autoconf (development)
* automake (development)

NOTE: The AffyIO module does not yet work on Cygwin - there is a
dependency on the R libraries.
