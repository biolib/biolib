= Using biolib Ruby

  cmake .
	make
	make test
	make install (as root)

will copy the shared libraries into the Ruby tree, for example the
directory /usr/lib/ruby/1.8/i486-linux/.

From here you can run Ruby and require, for example,
'biolib_ruby_example'. 

  ruby src/mappings/swig/ruby/test/test_example.rb 

should show Biolib_ruby_example.my_mod(7,3) renders 1 

See the other test scripts in ./src/mappings/swig/ruby/test.

= Using another Ruby location

The current packaging (gem and CMake) default to the first Ruby
interpreter in the path. To change this you may try:

 cmake -DRUBY_EXECUTABLE=/usr/local/bin/myruby -DBUILD_RUBY:BOOLEAN=TRUE . 

= Trouble shooting

== libR.so error

The error: biolib_ruby_affyio.so: libR.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Is due to the runtime dynamic library loader not finding libR.so. See
if you can fix it by something like:

  /lib/ld-linux.so.2 --library-path /usr/lib/R/lib /usr/bin/ruby test_affyio.rb

if this works you can add /usr/lib/R/lib ni /etc/ld.so.conf and build
the cache with ldconfig -v

== SWIG: Warning(801): Wrong class name (corrected to 

The Ruby module will give this warning when structures are named
starting with lowercase. It is harmless.

== cannot open shared object file

The following error can occur when BioLib and Ruby are compiled with different gcc compilers (the libstdc++.so library is a mismatch):

../affyio/affyio.so: libstdc++.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory - ../affyio/affyio.so (LoadError)
        from ./../test/test_affyio.rb:5

with NIX it is possible to create profiles with different Ruby/gcc
combinations - which is ideal for testing different dependencies.

== Link error

On some Debian systems an upgrade of Ruby causes:

/usr/include/unistd.h:268: error: declaration of 'int eaccess(const char*, int) throw ()' throws different exceptions
/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/x86_64-linux/missing.h:43: error: from previous declaration 'int eaccess(const char*, int)'

make sure to upgrade the ruby1.8-dev package.

== Runtime error

An error like:

/../test/test_example.rb:25:in `function': can't convert false into Float (TypeError)

happens when SWIG is using num2dbl from a Ruby array - and you go
beyond the last element.
