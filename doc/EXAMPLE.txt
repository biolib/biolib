* INTRODUCTION

To create mappings for a new module follow the addition of an example 
package (SWIG's exmample.c).


* GENERIC

First we create a new folder in ./src/clibs:

  mkdir ./src/clibs/example

perhaps it a version number is there for a contributed library that
is expected to be modified

  mkdir ./src/clibs/example-1.0

if it is contributed, but will remain unmodified move the folder into
./contrib e.g.

  mkdir ./contrib/example-1.0

and have ./src contain your mappings only:

	mkdir ./src/clibs/examples

next we add the code (see ./src/clibs/example example.c).  Includes go
into:

	mkdir ./src/clibs/examples/include

The language mappings go into ./src/mappings/swig - with the swig
input file ./src/mappings/swig/example.i in place for the module.

Next we get the language specific stuff...


* PYTHON

In ./src/mappings/swig/python/biolib_swig_python the building of
Python linked libraries is handled with tests in
./src/mappings/swig/python/test.

To build the python mappings you need the development version of
Python (/usr/include/python2.x/python.h should be on your system).


* RUBY

See ./src/mappings/swig/ruby/biolib_swig_ruby
