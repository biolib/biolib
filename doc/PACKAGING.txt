= PACKAGING WITH CMAKE

BioLib uses CMake to support cross-platform builds. CMake is easier to
work with than the autoconf tools (configure and friends) and more
coherent. The native build support is described in ./INSTALL and
./doc/BUILD.txt.

For packaging the build can be made into a 'build' directory with:

  cmake .
  make
	make DESTDIR=./build

which will store the full directory structure in ./build.

Note there is also a prefix which overrides building in /usr/local
with:

  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/biolib .
	make 
	make DESTDIR=./build
