= BioLib Testing =

== Unit testing ==

Every language binding comes with unit testing, which is invoked from
cmake.

== Stubs for large data blobs ==

Large data objects, like microarrays, are stored as a stub in the
source repository to prevent the source repository from getting too
large. See for example the microarray files in
./src/test/data/microarray/affy/test/.

The code for downloading the blob objects is in ./src/biolib/language.
Downloading blobs only happens during the first test run.
