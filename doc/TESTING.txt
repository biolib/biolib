== Unit testing ==

Unit testing falls into two categories. First there is a range of
unit tests executed from cmake. These have an integrative testing
purpose and should run relatively fast. From the root:

  cmake .
	make
	make test

Cmake can also be run at subdirectory level, assuming dependent
libraries have been built in other parts of the tree - reducing the
number of tests considerably.

Next there may separate test runners which are collected in
directories named 'test'. These are development testers.

== Regression testing ==

Regression tests have not been implemented yet, but will become
another category of tests.

== Stubs for large data blobs ==

Large data objects, like microarrays, are stored as a stub in the
source repository to prevent the source repository from getting too
large. See for example the microarray files in
./src/test/data/microarray/affy/test/.

The code for downloading the blob objects is in ./src/biolib/language.
Downloading blobs only happens during the first test run.
